# Project State — burritbot (Can Your Chatbot Run kubectl?)

## Verification Method
Tracker contents are reconciled against actual repo state (file reads,
`pytest --collect-only`, `git log`) at every transition — not from
prior session summaries. The "static tests passing" count below is
asserted by `tests/test_critical_fix_a6_project_state_truthful.py`,
which fails the suite if this number drifts from reality.

The senior-review pass on 2026-04-25 surfaced five demo-breaking
defects that all five Phase 1–8 scorecards had silently rated GREEN.
The lesson written into the state-persistence rule
(`~/.claude/rules/state-persistence.md`) — distinguish "written" from
"confirmed against reality" — is now enforced for the critical-fix
work tracked below.

## Current Status
**Phases 1–8 offline build complete; six critical defects (C1, C2,
C3, C4, C5, C9) found and repaired under TDD.** Commits land on
`staging` and ride the autonomous staging→main flow once each phase's
test passes. Live cluster validation (terraform apply, helm installs,
live Kyverno + Falco + Envoy + NeMo Guardrails smoke tests) remains
deferred to a session with GCP auth and cluster access.

**Recent rewrites (post-Phase-8):**
- Commit F (`0bd0f34`) — hard rename Deinopis → burritbot across 78 files.
- Commit G (`43b4db3`) — narrative shift to a lighthearted Act 1.
- Critical-fix series (this session) — see "Critical Fixes" below.

## Talk Context
- Talk: "Can Your Chatbot Run kubectl? Guardrails for LLMs on Kubernetes"
- Venue: KubeCon NA 2026, Salt Lake City
- Speakers: Whitney Lee and Michael Forrester
- Format: Two-act live demo (unguarded then guarded BurritBot on GKE)
- Platform name: **burritbot** (ogre-faced spider — The Eyes + The Net)
- Chatbot name: **BurritBot** (Chipotle viral chatbot incident as narrative hook)

## Critical Fixes (this session)
Plan: `docs/CRITICAL-FIXES-PLAN.md`. Each phase landed a failing test
first, then the minimum fix, then re-ran the full static suite before
commit.

| ID  | Fix                                                            | Test                                                  | Verified-Static | Verified-Live |

### Static Test Totals
- Phase 1: 8 passed
- Phase 2: 4 passed
- Phase 3: 6 passed
- Phase 4: 7 passed
- Phase 5: 6 passed
- Phase 6: 7 passed
- Phase 7: 7 passed
- Phase 8: 5 passed
- Critical-fix series: 21 passed
- **Total: 80 static tests green. Live tests skip cleanly when
  kubeconfig is absent — no mocks, no fallbacks.** Drift in this
  number is asserted against `pytest --collect-only -m static` by the
  Phase A6 test.

## Phase 1 Preconditions (authoritative)
1. **GCP project ID:** `burritbot-kubecon-2026` (placeholder — confirm real
   ID before `terraform apply`).
2. **Region:** `us-west1`.
3. **GKE mode:** **Standard with node auto-provisioning.** Not Autopilot —
   Falco DaemonSet needs privileged container support.
4. **Gemini model:** `gemini-3-pro` (GA) accessed via `google-genai` with
   `vertexai=True`. 1.5 is unsupported; 2.0 Flash is retired; 2.5 Flash/Pro
   retire 2026-10-16 — four weeks before the talk; 3 Flash is preview-tier.
   3 Pro is the only Vertex AI model guaranteed to be live on demo day.
5. **Audience frontend backend:** FastAPI (matches the rest of the stack).
6. **Licensing:** Apache 2.0 (matching kubeauto-ai-day lineage).

## Local Tooling
- Installed: `yamllint`, `jq`, `kyverno`, `shellcheck`, `uv`, `python3.13`
- Missing: `terraform`, `kubectl`, `kubeconform`, `helm`, `docker`

Offline TDD strategy: Python code via pytest; Kyverno via `kyverno test`;
YAML via yamllint; JSON dashboards via `jq empty`; shell via shellcheck;
Terraform `validate` deferred to a session with Terraform installed.

## Known Gaps (deferred — not blocking the critical-fix series)

These were surfaced in the senior review but are out of scope for the
critical-fix pass. Each is tracked here so a future session can pick
them up without re-discovering them.

### From the senior review
- **C3 live verification.** Colang `1.0` matches the rail syntax, but
  this needs to be confirmed against a running NeMo Guardrails 0.11
  container before demo day.
- **C7 — CORS `allow_origins=["*"]`.** Lock to known audience hostnames.
- **C8 — per-pod rate limiter.** slowapi in-memory storage scales
  per replica; either keep replicas: 1 or wire to Redis.
- **C10 — `cast-net.sh` hardcoded `containers/0`.** Switch to
  `kubectl set env deployment/...` or look up by container name.
- **C11 — Terraform GCS backend.** No `backend "gcs"` block; first
  `terraform apply` writes local state.
- **C12 — Public GKE nodes.** No `private_cluster_config` despite the
  NAT gateway suggesting private intent.
- **C13 — `deletion_protection = false`.** Combined with
  `teardown.sh --yes`, the cluster could be destroyed by a stray CI run.
- All Medium/Low items (#14–#27 in the senior review).

### Newly surfaced (deeper structural)
- **No Deployment manifests for the AI Gateway / NeMo / LLM Guard /
  OTel Collector / Falco DaemonSet / Grafana dashboards.** The
  `deploy/` Kustomizations created in Phase A1 are deliberately
  shallow — they reference what *is* deployable today (Kyverno
  ClusterPolicies, Envoy Gateway CR, BurritBot + audience workloads)
  and carry TODO comments for the rest. Future work needs to author
  the missing manifests (ConfigMap-wrap configs, Deployment specs,
  ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor, etc.).

## Next Session — Phase 1 Live Validation
Once a GCP project is confirmed and Terraform is installed:

```bash
claude -p "Read CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_STATE.md, docs/BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md, \
docs/PLAN.md, and docs/CRITICAL-FIXES-PLAN.md. Validate Phase 1: GKE \
Foundation. Run terraform validate, terraform plan, then terraform apply. \
Run tests/test_phase_01_foundation.py with the live marker." --max-iterations 20
```

Then walk Phases 2 → 8 forward in the same autonomous staging→main
workflow, promoting YELLOW scorecard rows to GREEN as each live check
passes. **Do not green-wash the scorecard.**

## Demo-Day Artifacts (Phase 8)
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — Pre-flight / Act 1 / Cast the Net / Act 2 / Teardown / Rollback
- `docs/SCORECARD.md` — honest per-component status, YELLOW where live
  validation has not happened yet
- `docs/CRITICAL-FIXES-PLAN.md` — the senior-review repair plan
- `scripts/teardown.sh` — `terraform destroy` with a two-step confirmation
- `scripts/cast-net.sh` — the single-command live traffic toggle

## Branch & Test Status
- **Branch**: `staging` (default working branch)
- **Remote**: `origin → https://github.com/peopleforrester/can-your-chatbot-run-kubectl`
- **Static tests**: 80 passing, 0 failing, live tests skip when kubeconfig absent
